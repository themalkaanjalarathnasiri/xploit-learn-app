# AI Integrated Mobile Learning App for Vulnerability Analysis

This project is an AI-powered mobile learning platform designed to teach users about vulnerability analysis in the context of cybersecurity. It leverages Google Gemini for personalized, context-aware lesson generation and integrates hands-on labs for practical learning. The app focuses on real-time feedback, personalized learning paths, and comprehensive cybersecurity training, helping users enhance their understanding of vulnerabilities and how to protect against them.
